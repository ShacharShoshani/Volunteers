# TODO
* Fix UI problem in organization and activity add forms:

  A location search with many results will push the map down and expend the ScrollView. It makes map movement problematic

* Attach volunteering activities a schedule in the form of a dates list
* Enable users to assign as volunteers to activities opend by other users
* Prevent db records duplication
* Upload images for user's profile, organizations and volunteering activities
